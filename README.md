This app can be used in real-life scenarios like:
- **Board games** when physical dice are missing.
- **Ice-breaker activities** where random choices are needed.
- **Teaching randomness or probability** in an educational context.
- **Mini-games or game prototypes** involving dice mechanics.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Tap to roll a virtual die (displays numbers from 1â€“6).
- Visually updates the dice face with a smooth UI.
- Custom gradient background for visual appeal.
- Modular widget-based structure using Flutter best practices.
